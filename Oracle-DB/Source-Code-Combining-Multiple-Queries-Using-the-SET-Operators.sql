--Example 1:
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees WHERE department_id = 30
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM retired_employees
ORDER BY salary;

--Example 2:
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees WHERE department_id = 30
MINUS
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM retired_employees
ORDER BY salary;

--Example 3:
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees
MINUS
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees WHERE department_id = 30
INTERSECT
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM retired_employees
ORDER BY salary;

--Example 4: Using parentheses will change the execution order of the queries in Compound Queries.
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees
MINUS
(SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees WHERE department_id = 30
INTERSECT
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM retired_employees)
ORDER BY salary;

--Example 5: This query will not run. Because the ORDER BY clause must be placed at the end of the compound query and it must be outside of the parentheses.
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees
MINUS
(SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees WHERE department_id = 30
INTERSECT
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM retired_employees
ORDER BY salary);

--Example 6: This query will also not run. Because the ORDER BY clause must be placed at the end of the compound query and it must be outside of the parentheses.
(SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees
MINUS
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees WHERE department_id = 30
INTERSECT
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM retired_employees)
ORDER BY salary);
